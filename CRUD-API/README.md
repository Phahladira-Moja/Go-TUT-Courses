NB - Gorilla mux does not come as part of Go's main package, so we have to install separately.
    - go get "github.com/gorilla/mux"

- This application is a basic CRUD-API system that doesn't actually write to a database.
- We have used a slice to simulate one and just tom show a CRUD-API would work.
